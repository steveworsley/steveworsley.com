Attempting this was my first mistake. My second was to assume it would a relatively straightforward subject to research. Imagine opening a Jack in the Box but instead of the cute/terrifying clown popping out up comes both Nigel Farage and David Cameron to slap you round the face. Talk about nightmares. You would soon lock that box, put it in a dark place never to be opened again. This is what it was like researching the EU.

As I waded amongst the sludge of information about the EU itself ((link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area text: Schengen Area), the (link: https://fullfact.org/europe/what-single-market/ text: single market), the (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutions_of_the_European_Union text: 7 institutions)) and dodged the shit being flung from side to side of the (link: https://twitter.com/search?q=%23brexit text: #brexit) campaign I discovered two independent organisations who were doing a much better job of making sense of it all.

(link: https://fullfact.org/ text: Fullfact.org) ((link: https://www.facebook.com/FullFact.org/ text: Facebook), (link: https://twitter.com/FullFact text: Twitter)) are an independent fact checking service which checks claims by politicians and the media. The have a some great articles on the EU including (link: https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-migration-and-uk/ text: Immigration), (link: https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-law-and-uk/ text: EU and UK law), and (link: https://fullfact.org/europe/norway-switzerland-eu-laws/ text: Norway, Switzerland and EU law). They also have a section for you to (link: https://fullfact.org/ask/ text: ask questions) and are running a (link: http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/eu-referendum-factchecked text: Kickstarter) to fund more EU referendum fact checking stuff. I would suggest that fullfact.org is the best place to get unbiased information on the EU referendum and they are doing a grand job.

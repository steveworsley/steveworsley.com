Sex in Strange Places is an episodic documentary covering the issues sex workers face in different countries.  Stacey Dooley manages to connect with people in such a way that you get to see what's beneath the strong facade of the women and transsexual women  - usually someone down on their luck, in need of money and ostracised from society. The episodes are on [BBC Three](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03kskp6/episodes/player) and are worth a watch.

Some interesting notes from the first episode:

* Prostitution of women is legal in Turkey and run by the state - the brothels have security guards and metal detectors.
* The sex education in Turkey is so bad prostitutes sometimes get men being intimate with their belly buttons... 
* Transsexual prostitutes in Brazil have a life expectancy of 30!

#### Eggy Fish Fingers

This seemed like a good idea but it was actually terrible. I’m not sure what came over us to try something which combines fish, eggs and onions. It’s just asking for grumbling stomachs and bad wind. I can only suspect it’s a hit with Hugh’s children because it makes their dad fart so much. We tried fish from the fishmongers but it just wasn’t the crispy delight the recipe made it out to be. Also, the spring onion rice was shit.

#### Cheat’s Pizza

We couldn’t get this right at all. It kept coming out too thick or just not cooked to our liking. We gave it a few good goes but gave up in the end. It didn’t help that we couldn’t pop our frying pan under the grill. Some of the salads were nice but as with most recipes in the 30 Minute Meals book the amount of food is too much for 2 people.

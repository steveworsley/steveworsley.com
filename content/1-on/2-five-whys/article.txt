If you’ve ever had a hard decision to make, stumbling through a fuzzy cloud of choices & apprehension, then the Five Whys technique might help. It will guide you in finding the root cause behind a problem or your true motivation behind an action.

### Technique

Simply ask **why**, repeat up to five times & give yourself time to think through the answers.

For example: *“I fancy a bag of crisps.”*

1. Why do you want a bag of crisps?

    *“If I want food then I must be hungry.”*

2. Why are you hungry?

    *“Well I did just have lunch & my stomach doesn’t really feel hungry. So maybe I’m just bored & want to procrastinate.”*

3. Why do you want to procrastinate?

    *“Mainly because I don’t find this work engaging. It’s boring.”*

4. Why do you find the work boring?

   *“It’s not something I’m interested in. I’m not invested in it & it doesn’t make me happy. Maybe I should leave my job.”*

So this example became serious pretty fast & it didn’t even need five repetitions to get to the real crux of the problem. You could then take the last answer & use the Five Whys technique again with “Why haven’t you left your job yet”

Five is the ideal amount of times you’ll need to question yourself about a problem. Any more than that may result in an existential crisis.

### Origins

The Five Whys technique is also called ‘root cause analysis’ & was originally developed by Sakichi Toyada of Toyota. Or more likely one of his kids who just wanted to annoy him.
